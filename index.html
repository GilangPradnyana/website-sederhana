          Computer Science is the study of computers and computational
          systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer
          scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this
          includes their theory, design, development, and application.
          Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial
          intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems,
          human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming
          languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.
          Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science,
          it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze
          algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and
          software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the
          abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the
          complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing
          applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold 
          security measures.
          Graduates of University of Maryland’s Computer Science Department are lifetime
          learners; they are able to adapt quickly with this challenging field.
